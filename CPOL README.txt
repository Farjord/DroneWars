BUGS TO FIX
AI - Don't play Out Think if the opponent has passed. 
AI - Got incorrect lethal bonus when using Armor-Piercing Shot
Upgrades - Show limit per card on the popup. 
AI - Chose to buff a card that didn't have a clear line of attack - both were valued the same. 
Avenger Drone - Not Triggering

?Still exists?
AI - targeting of damage cards is too low on the priority, especially if taking out high value, ready piece. Revisit. 
AI - Bomber only scoring 8 for attacking the bridge??

I am in the process of migrating my game so that it multiplayer compatible. This means moving core logic functions out of the app.jsx into gameLogic.js.

Can you advise me of the next step to undertake, please? 

I want to go through this one small step at a time, so please do not provide instructions for the entire refactor, just the next part to move.
