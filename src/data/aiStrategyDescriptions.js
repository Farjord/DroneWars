    tip: "Deploy interceptors carefully",
    explanation: "Fast drones can block AI attacks. AI recognizes this and may target interceptors or use unchecked threats."
  },
  {
    tip: "Protect damaged sections",
    explanation: "AI gets large bonuses for attacking damaged/critical sections. Use Guardians or interceptors to protect them."
  },
  {
    tip: "Bait anti-ship drones",
    explanation: "AI gets penalties for using bombers against drones. You can bait them into suboptimal trades."
  },
  {
    tip: "Understand threat scaling",
    explanation: "AI won't waste high-speed interceptors on weak attackers, but will readily use them against trivial threats (1 ATK)."
  },
  {
    tip: "Lane control matters",
    explanation: "AI heavily weights lane scores. Flipping a lane from losing to winning triggers large bonuses."
  },
  {
    tip: "Energy denial works",
    explanation: "AI reserves energy for its most expensive card. If you can make it spend energy, it may be forced to deploy less."
  },
  {
    tip: "Position matters for AI",
    explanation: "AI won't overkill lanes with critical sections. You can sometimes safely leave a critical section if the lane is already lost."
