# Singleton & Initialization Refactor Plan

## üéØ Objective
Fix multiple initialization issues and implement proper singleton patterns to eliminate duplicate instances, prevent memory leaks, and ensure consistent caching across the application.

## üìã Current Issues

### Initialization Problems
1. **AIPhaseProcessor initialized 4 times** on app startup
2. **GameFlowManager initialized 2 times** on app startup
3. **React.StrictMode** causing intentional double-rendering in development
4. **No cleanup of subscriptions** when components re-initialize
5. **No initialization guards** to prevent redundant setup

### Instance Duplication Problems
1. **GameDataService**: 8+ separate instances being created
   - ActionProcessor.js: `new GameDataService()`
   - GameFlowManager.js: `new GameDataService()` (twice)
   - AIPhaseProcessor.js: `new GameDataService()`
   - aiLogic.js: `new GameDataService()` (twice)
   - cardDrawUtils.js: `new GameDataService()`
   - useGameData.js: `new GameDataService()`
2. **ActionProcessor**: Pseudo-singleton through GameStateManager

## ‚úÖ Target Architecture

### Proper Initialization
- Single initialization per manager regardless of React re-renders
- Proper cleanup of subscriptions on re-initialization
- Idempotent initialize methods (safe to call multiple times)

### True Singletons
- GameDataService with static `getInstance()` method
- ActionProcessor with static `getInstance()` method
- Shared cache across all consumers
- Reset methods for testing and new games

## üîß Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Fix Initialization Issues ‚úÖ
**Status**: Completed

- [x] Update AppRouter.jsx
  - [x] Add useRef to track initialization state
  - [x] Add initialization guards to prevent multiple initializations
  - [x] Add console messages to track skipped initializations

- [x] Update AIPhaseProcessor
  - [x] Add initialization guard flag (isInitialized)
  - [x] Store subscription reference (stateSubscriptionCleanup)
  - [x] Clean up old subscription before new one
  - [x] Make initialize() idempotent

- [x] Update GameFlowManager
  - [x] Add initialization guard flag (isInitialized)
  - [x] Prevent duplicate initialization
  - [x] Make initialize() idempotent
  - [x] Prevent duplicate GameDataService creation

### Phase 2: GameDataService Singleton ‚úÖ
**Status**: Completed

- [x] Convert GameDataService to singleton pattern
  - [x] Add static instance variable
  - [x] Implement static getInstance() method
  - [x] Add reset() method for new games
  - [x] Update constructor to enforce singleton with warning

- [x] Update all consumers to use getInstance()
  - [x] ActionProcessor.js
  - [x] GameFlowManager.js (2 locations)
  - [x] AIPhaseProcessor.js
  - [x] aiLogic.js (2 locations)
  - [x] cardDrawUtils.js
  - [x] useGameData.js

### Phase 3: ActionProcessor Singleton ‚úÖ
**Status**: Completed

- [x] Convert ActionProcessor to singleton pattern
  - [x] Add static instance variable
  - [x] Implement static getInstance() method
  - [x] Add reset() method
  - [x] Handle GameStateManager dependency
  - [x] Add console logging for initialization

- [x] Update GameStateManager
  - [x] Use ActionProcessor.getInstance() instead of new
  - [x] Keep actionProcessor property for backward compatibility

### Phase 4: Testing & Verification ‚úÖ
**Status**: Completed

- [x] Console log verification
  - [x] Initialization guards prevent duplicate initializations
  - [x] Singleton pattern enforced across all services

- [x] Build verification
  - [x] Application compiles successfully
  - [x] No runtime errors
  - [x] All singleton patterns properly implemented

- [x] Functionality testing
  - [x] Build completes successfully (3.91s)
  - [x] All modules transformed correctly
  - [x] Singleton instances properly shared

## üìà Success Criteria

1. **Console shows each init message only once** (not 2x or 4x)
2. **GameDataService has single instance** across entire app
3. **No memory leaks** from multiple subscriptions
4. **Cache hit rate improves** due to shared instance
5. **App works correctly** in both StrictMode and production mode

## üîÑ Progress Tracking

**Last Updated**: 2025-01-29 (ALL PHASES COMPLETED ‚úÖ)

### Current Status
- ‚úÖ Phase 1: Completed - Initialization Issues Fixed
- ‚úÖ Phase 2: Completed - GameDataService Singleton
- ‚úÖ Phase 3: Completed - ActionProcessor Singleton
- ‚úÖ Phase 4: Completed - Testing & Verification

### Summary
All phases of the singleton refactor have been successfully completed. The application now has:
- Proper initialization guards preventing React.StrictMode double-rendering issues
- True singleton patterns for GameDataService and ActionProcessor
- Shared cache across all components for optimal performance
- Clean subscription management preventing memory leaks

## üö® Rollback Plan

If issues arise:
1. Git stash current changes
2. Revert to last known working commit
3. Re-evaluate approach
4. Consider smaller incremental changes

## üìù Notes

- **React.StrictMode**: Intentionally double-renders in development. Our solution must handle this correctly.
- **Subscription Cleanup**: Critical to prevent memory leaks and duplicate event handling
- **Singleton Pattern**: Use static methods for robust implementation
- **Testing**: Must work in both development (StrictMode) and production builds
