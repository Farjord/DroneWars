# Drone Wars - Long-Term Development Roadmap

## üéØ **STRATEGIC VISION**

**Goal:** Transform current client-side game into robust server-based multiplayer system with advanced features.

**Current Phase:** Phase 3 - Server Implementation (Ready to Begin)
**Completed Phase:** Phase 2.12 - Component Data Flow Consistency (Completed 2025-09-27)

---

## ‚úÖ **COMPLETED PHASES**

### **Phase 2.11: GameDataService Implementation (2025-09-27)**
**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETED

**Achievement:** 100% centralization of all effective stats calculations

**Components Delivered:**
- **GameDataService.js** - Centralized computation coordinator
- **gameDataCache.js** - Performance caching layer with automatic state-change invalidation
- **useGameData.js** - React hook for clean component integration

**Migration Results:**
- ‚úÖ 78+ scattered calculation calls eliminated across 8+ files
- ‚úÖ Both drone stats (calculateEffectiveStats) and ship stats (calculateEffectiveShipStats) centralized
- ‚úÖ App.jsx playerEffectiveStats useMemo replaced with direct GameDataService calls
- ‚úÖ Intelligent caching with automatic invalidation on game state changes
- ‚úÖ Zero functional changes - pure architectural improvement
- ‚úÖ 100% verification: No direct calculation calls remain in application code
- ‚úÖ Perfect abstraction layer ready for server migration

**Architecture Impact:**
- Clean data flow: GameStateManager ‚Üî GameDataService ‚Üî gameDataCache ‚Üî gameLogic.js
- Server-ready: GameDataService provides ideal abstraction for client-server migration
- Performance: Automatic caching prevents redundant expensive calculations
- Maintainability: Single source of truth for all computed game data

### **Phase 2.12: Component Data Flow Consistency (2025-09-27)**
**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETED

**Goal:** Eliminate prop drilling for computed stats by standardizing all utility functions to use GameDataService consistently

**Problem Identified:**
- Mixed patterns: Components used GameDataService but utility functions bypassed it with direct calculations
- Critical Issue: Middle lane bonuses not applied due to architectural violations in utils and gameLogic
- Ship sections showed correct UI stats but actual game values were wrong (energy, hand limits)

**Migration Scope Completed:**
- **cardDrawUtils.js**: ‚úÖ Replaced hardcoded `defaultHandLimit = 5` with GameDataService effective stats calculations
- **gameLogic.js**: ‚úÖ Fixed `initialPlayerState()` energy initialization to use proper placed sections
- **aiLogic.js**: ‚úÖ Removed redundant `calculateEffectiveShipStats` parameter, use only GameDataService
- **GameFlowManager.js**: ‚úÖ Updated to pass gameStateManager to performAutomaticDraw()

**Critical Fixes Achieved:**
- ‚úÖ **Power Cell Middle Lane**: Now correctly provides 12 energy (10 base + 2 bonus) instead of 10
- ‚úÖ **Bridge Middle Lane**: Now correctly provides 6 card hand limit (5 base + 1 bonus) instead of 5
- ‚úÖ **UI-Game Value Consistency**: Stats displayed in UI now match actual game mechanics
- ‚úÖ **100% GameDataService Usage**: Complete elimination of direct calculation bypasses

**Architecture Benefits Realized:**
- Component independence: No prop drilling for computed data
- Architectural consistency: All components and utilities follow identical data access patterns
- Server migration ready: Direct hooks translate cleanly to server-based data fetching
- Cache efficiency: GameDataService handles multiple calls efficiently
- Bug elimination: Middle lane bonuses now work correctly across all game systems

### **Phase 2.13: Stats Calculator Extraction (2025-09-27)**
**Status:** üìã PLANNED

**Goal:** Extract stats calculation logic from gameLogic.js to eliminate circular dependencies and complete GameDataService architecture

**Problem Identified:**
- gameLogic.js both provides `calculateEffectiveShipStats` and consumes it, creating circular dependency
- GameDataService imports from gameLogic.js, but gameLogic.js should use GameDataService
- This causes the energy initialization bug where function references are passed instead of calculated values
- Architecture confusion about whether to use GameDataService or direct calculation calls

**Implementation Plan:**
- **Create statsCalculator.js**: New module containing pure calculation functions
  - Move `calculateEffectiveShipStats` from gameLogic.js
  - Move `calculateEffectiveStats` from gameLogic.js
  - No dependencies on GameDataService (pure functions only)
- **Update GameDataService**: Import from statsCalculator.js instead of gameLogic.js
- **Update gameLogic.js**: Use GameDataService for all stats calculations
  - Fix `processRoundStart` to use GameDataService
  - Update all 9+ direct calculation calls
  - Remove calculation function exports
- **Verification**: Ensure no circular dependencies remain

**Expected Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ **Clean Architecture**: Clear separation between calculation logic and consumption
- ‚úÖ **Energy Bug Fix**: Proper stats calculation in processRoundStart
- ‚úÖ **No Cache Bypassing**: All calculations go through GameDataService
- ‚úÖ **Maintainability**: Single source of truth for calculations
- ‚úÖ **Testing**: Easier to test pure calculation functions in isolation

**Critical Fixes This Enables:**
- Power Cell middle lane energy bonus (12 energy instead of 0)
- All round start energy calculations
- Consistent caching across entire application

## üöÄ **PHASE 3: SERVER IMPLEMENTATION**

### **Priority 1: Create Server Layer**

**Goal:** Build dedicated game server infrastructure

**Components to Implement:**
- **server/GameServer.js** - Central game instance server
  - Hosts individual game sessions
  - Manages game state server-side
  - Handles player actions and validation
  - Broadcasts state updates to clients

- **server/SessionManager.js** - Handle multiple game sessions
  - Create/join/leave game sessions
  - Session lifecycle management
  - Player matchmaking and lobbies
  - Session persistence and recovery

- **server/PlayerConnectionManager.js** - Manage player connections
  - WebSocket connection handling
  - Player authentication and authorization
  - Connection state management
  - Disconnection/reconnection handling

- **network/GameClient.js** - Client-side network interface
  - Abstract network layer for App.jsx
  - Action queuing and retry logic
  - State synchronization
  - Connection status management

### **Priority 2: Network Integration**

**Goal:** Replace P2P system with client-server architecture

**Migration Tasks:**
- **Remove P2P System**: Remove current PeerJS multiplayer implementation
- **WebSocket Implementation**: Replace with client-server WebSocket communication
- **App.jsx Refactor**: Update to connect to server instead of direct game logic
- **Action Routing**: Route all player actions through network layer to server
- **State Management**: Client receives state updates rather than managing state directly

### **Priority 3: Server-Side Game Logic Migration**

**Goal:** Move game logic to server for authoritative gameplay

**Server Migration:**
- **Move Core Managers**: GameStateManager, GameFlowManager, SimultaneousActionManager to server
- **Client Simplification**: Keep only UI state management on client (App.jsx)
- **Validation Layer**: Implement server-side action validation and anti-cheat measures
- **Observer Pattern**: Add spectator mode support
