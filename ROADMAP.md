# Drone Wars - Long-Term Development Roadmap

## üéØ **STRATEGIC VISION**

**Goal:** Transform current client-side game into robust server-based multiplayer system with advanced features.

**Current Phase:** Phase 2.9 Complete - Server-Ready Architecture Achieved
**Next Major Phase:** Phase 3 - Full Server Implementation

---

## üöÄ **PHASE 3: SERVER IMPLEMENTATION**

### **Priority 1: Create Server Layer**

**Goal:** Build dedicated game server infrastructure

**Components to Implement:**
- **server/GameServer.js** - Central game instance server
  - Hosts individual game sessions
  - Manages game state server-side
  - Handles player actions and validation
  - Broadcasts state updates to clients

- **server/SessionManager.js** - Handle multiple game sessions
  - Create/join/leave game sessions
  - Session lifecycle management
  - Player matchmaking and lobbies
  - Session persistence and recovery

- **server/PlayerConnectionManager.js** - Manage player connections
  - WebSocket connection handling
  - Player authentication and authorization
  - Connection state management
  - Disconnection/reconnection handling

- **network/GameClient.js** - Client-side network interface
  - Abstract network layer for App.jsx
  - Action queuing and retry logic
  - State synchronization
  - Connection status management

### **Priority 2: Network Integration**

**Goal:** Replace P2P system with client-server architecture

**Migration Tasks:**
- **Remove P2P System**: Remove current PeerJS multiplayer implementation
- **WebSocket Implementation**: Replace with client-server WebSocket communication
- **App.jsx Refactor**: Update to connect to server instead of direct game logic
- **Action Routing**: Route all player actions through network layer to server
- **State Management**: Client receives state updates rather than managing state directly

### **Priority 3: Server-Side Game Logic Migration**

**Goal:** Move game logic to server for authoritative gameplay

**Server Migration:**
- **Move Core Managers**: GameStateManager, GameFlowManager, SimultaneousActionManager to server
- **Client Simplification**: Keep only UI state management on client (App.jsx)
- **Validation Layer**: Implement server-side action validation and anti-cheat measures
- **Observer Pattern**: Add spectator mode support

## üîÆ **PHASE 4: ADVANCED FEATURES**

### **Enhanced Multiplayer Experience**
- **Lobby System**: Advanced game creation and joining
- **Player Profiles**: User accounts and statistics
- **Matchmaking**: Skill-based player matching
- **Tournament Mode**: Bracket-style competitions

### **Gameplay Features**
- **Replay System**: Record and playback games
- **Spectator Mode**: Watch games in progress
- **Custom Game Modes**: Variations of core gameplay
- **Achievement System**: Player progression and rewards

### **Technical Infrastructure**
- **Anti-Cheat System**: Server-side validation and monitoring
- **Scaling Architecture**: Support for multiple game servers
- **Database Integration**: Persistent player data and game history
- **Analytics**: Game balance and player behavior tracking

## üèóÔ∏è **TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE EVOLUTION**

### **Current Architecture (Phase 2.9)**
```
Client: App.jsx ‚Üî GameManagers ‚Üî GameStateManager
```

### **Target Architecture (Phase 3)**
```
Client: App.jsx ‚Üî GameClient ‚Üî WebSocket ‚Üî GameServer ‚Üî GameManagers ‚Üî GameStateManager
```

### **Future Architecture (Phase 4)**
```
Multiple Clients ‚Üî Load Balancer ‚Üî Game Server Cluster ‚Üî Database Layer
```

---

## üìã **TECHNOLOGY STACK DECISIONS**

### **Server Technology**
- **Runtime**: Node.js (consistency with client development)
- **WebSocket Library**: Socket.io (robust, well-tested)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (ACID compliance for game state)
- **Caching**: Redis (session management, real-time data)

### **Deployment Strategy**
- **Development**: Local server with hot reload
- **Staging**: Docker containers for consistency
- **Production**: Cloud deployment (scalable infrastructure)

### **Security Considerations**
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens for player sessions
- **Validation**: Server-side action validation
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent spam and DoS attacks
- **Encryption**: TLS for all client-server communication

---

## üéÆ **GAMEPLAY EVOLUTION**

### **Enhanced Game Modes**
- **Quick Play**: Fast matchmaking for casual games
- **Ranked Play**: Competitive ladder system
- **Custom Lobbies**: Player-created game rooms
- **AI Training**: Practice against improved AI

### **Content Expansion**
- **New Drone Types**: Additional units with unique abilities
- **Map Variations**: Different battlefield layouts
- **Card Expansions**: New strategy cards and mechanics
- **Seasonal Events**: Limited-time game modes and rewards
