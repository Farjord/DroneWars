# Architecture Refactor Plan

## üéØ Objective
Eliminate duplicate state updates and race conditions by establishing single ownership for every state field and removing unnecessary manager components.

## üìã Current Issues
1. **Multiple components updating same state fields** (passInfo, currentPlayer, etc.)
2. **Race conditions** from competing state updates
3. **Cascading phase completion events** causing infinite loops
4. **Unnecessary complexity** from redundant managers
5. **Unclear ownership boundaries** for state management

## ‚úÖ Target Architecture

### Simple Flow
```
User/AI Action ‚Üí ActionProcessor ‚Üí GameStateManager ‚Üí GameFlowManager ‚Üí Phase Transition
                                          ‚Üì
                                   AIPhaseProcessor (self-triggers when AI turn)
```

### Component Responsibilities
1. **ActionProcessor**: Executes ALL actions, updates ALL game state
2. **GameFlowManager**: Watches state, decides phase transitions only
3. **AIPhaseProcessor**: Makes AI decisions, self-triggers on AI turns
4. **GameStateManager**: Stores state, emits change events

### Components to Delete
- ‚ùå SequentialPhaseManager
- ‚ùå SimultaneousActionManager

## üìä State Ownership Map

| State Field | Owner | Notes |
|------------|-------|-------|
| turnPhase | GameFlowManager | Via ActionProcessor |
| turn (round) | GameFlowManager | Via ActionProcessor |
| currentPlayer | ActionProcessor | All turn switches |
| passInfo | ActionProcessor | All pass updates |
| commitments | ActionProcessor | Simultaneous phases |
| player1/2 data | ActionProcessor | All game actions |
| placedSections | ActionProcessor | Placement phase |
| gameMode | Init only | Never changes |
| appState | Init only | Never changes |

## üìù Notes

- **IMPORTANT**: Update this file after completing each phase
- Test thoroughly after each phase before proceeding
- Keep backup of current code before starting
- Focus on single-player mode first (AI triggering is critical)
- Document any unexpected issues or changes needed

## üö® Rollback Plan

If issues arise:
1. Git stash current changes
2. Revert to last known working commit
3. Re-evaluate approach
4. Consider smaller incremental changes
