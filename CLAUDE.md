- **server/PlayerConnectionManager.js** - Manage player connections
- **network/GameClient.js** - Client-side network interface

**Priority 2: Network Integration**
- Remove current P2P (PeerJS) multiplayer system
- Replace with client-server WebSocket communication
- Update App.jsx to connect to server instead of direct game logic
- Route all actions through network layer to server

**Priority 3: Server-Side Game Logic**
- Move GameStateManager, GameFlowManager, SimultaneousActionManager to server
- Keep only UI state management on client (App.jsx)
- Implement server-side validation and anti-cheat measures
- Add spectator mode support

## üéØ **SERVER IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**

### **Phase 3.1: Server Infrastructure**

**Create Core Server Components:**
```javascript
// server/GameServer.js - Central game instance
class GameServer {
  constructor() {
    this.gameStateManager = new GameStateManager();
    this.gameFlowManager = new GameFlowManager();
    this.simultaneousActionManager = new SimultaneousActionManager();
    this.aiPhaseProcessor = new AIPhaseProcessor();
  }

  handlePlayerAction(playerId, action) {
    // Route to appropriate manager
    // Broadcast state changes to clients
  }
}

// server/SessionManager.js - Multiple game sessions
class SessionManager {
  createGame(hostPlayerId) { /* */ }
  joinGame(gameId, playerId) { /* */ }
  endGame(gameId) { /* */ }
}

// network/GameClient.js - Client network interface
class GameClient {
  connect(serverId) { /* */ }
  sendAction(action) { /* */ }
  onStateUpdate(callback) { /* */ }
}
```

### **Phase 3.2: Network Protocol**

**Define Client-Server Messages:**
```javascript
// Client ‚Üí Server
{
  type: 'PLAYER_ACTION',
  gameId: 'abc123',
  playerId: 'player1',
  action: {
    type: 'submitDroneSelection',
    data: { drones: [...] }
  }
}

// Server ‚Üí Client
{
  type: 'GAME_STATE_UPDATE',
  gameId: 'abc123',
  updates: {
    turnPhase: 'deckSelection',
    player1: { /* updated player state */ }
  }
}
```

### **Phase 3.3: Client Refactor**

**Update App.jsx for Network:**
- Replace direct manager calls with network requests
- Keep local UI state management
- Add connection status handling
- Add reconnection logic

**Remove P2P System:**
- Remove PeerJS dependency
- Remove MultiplayerLobby P2P logic
- Replace with server lobby system

### **Phase 3.4: Advanced Features**

**Server-Side Features:**
- Game session persistence
- Spectator mode
- Replay system
- Anti-cheat validation
- Disconnection handling

## üèÜ **ACHIEVED ARCHITECTURE BENEFITS**

‚úÖ **Pure Component Design** - All managers are mode-agnostic and server-ready
‚úÖ **AI Integration** - AI uses same pathways as human players
‚úÖ **Clean Separation** - Game flow vs. commitment coordination properly separated
‚úÖ **Event-Driven** - Managers communicate via events, not direct coupling
‚úÖ **Player Perspective** - UI maintains contextual view regardless of underlying mode
‚úÖ **Conditional Phases** - GameFlowManager skips unnecessary phases automatically
‚úÖ **Automatic Phase System** - No-input phases (draw, first player) happen automatically without player coordination
‚úÖ **Mixed Phase Architecture** - Seamless transitions between Simultaneous, Automatic, and Sequential phase types
‚úÖ **Utility Functions** - Clean, testable, reusable phase utilities (drone selection, ship placement, card drawing, first player determination)
‚úÖ **ActionProcessor Integration** - Proper validation exemptions for automatic phases while maintaining security

---

## üéÆ **CURRENT GAME FLOW (WORKING)**

### **Pre-Game Flow (Simultaneous Phases):**
1. **droneSelection** ‚Üí SimultaneousActionManager coordinates player commitments
2. **deckSelection** ‚Üí SimultaneousActionManager coordinates player commitments
3. **placement** ‚Üí SimultaneousActionManager coordinates player commitments

### **Round Loop Flow (Mixed Phase Types):**
4. **mandatoryDiscard** (Simultaneous) ‚Üí Only if players exceed hand limit
5. **draw** (Automatic) ‚Üí GameFlowManager handles automatically with cardDrawUtils
6. **determineFirstPlayer** (Automatic) ‚Üí GameFlowManager handles automatically with firstPlayerUtils
7. **allocateShields** (Simultaneous) ‚Üí Only if players have shields to allocate
8. **mandatoryDroneRemoval** (Simultaneous) ‚Üí Only if players exceed drone limit
9. **deployment** (Sequential) ‚Üí ActionProcessor handles turn-based play
10. **action** (Sequential) ‚Üí ActionProcessor handles turn-based play

### **Phase Type Architecture:**
- **Simultaneous Phases**: Coordinated by SimultaneousActionManager (player commitments + AI auto-completion)
- **Automatic Phases**: Handled directly by GameFlowManager (no player input, just happens and progresses)
- **Sequential Phases**: Handled by ActionProcessor (turn-based with proper action validation)

### **Conditional Phase Logic:**
- GameFlowManager.isPhaseRequired() skips unnecessary phases automatically
- Phases only execute if game state requires them (e.g., skip mandatoryDiscard if no hand limit violations)

**The architecture now features a clean separation between player interaction phases and automatic system phases, ready for server deployment.**
