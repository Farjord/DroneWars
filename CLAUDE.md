---

## üîë **CORE DESIGN DECISIONS**

### **Game Mode Detection Pattern**
- **Decision**: Use `gameMode !== 'local'` consistently across all components
- **Storage**: GameStateManager stores `gameMode` with values:
  - `'local'` = single-player (human is player1, AI is player2)
  - `'host'` = multiplayer host (this player is player1)
  - `'guest'` = multiplayer guest (this player is player2)
- **Rationale**: Single source of truth, clear semantics, no undefined fields
- **Critical**: Never use `multiplayer.enabled` - this field doesn't exist in the architecture

### **Phase Management Architecture**
- **Sequential Phases**: Turn-based gameplay (deployment, action)
  - Managed by `SequentialPhaseManager`
  - Automatic AI turn detection in single-player mode
  - Pass logic and phase transition coordination
  - Configurable AI response delay (default: 1.5 seconds)

- **Simultaneous Phases**: Commitment-based gameplay (selection, placement)
  - Managed by `SimultaneousActionManager`
  - Player commitment collection and validation
  - Instant AI auto-completion for single-player

- **Automatic Phases**: System-driven progression (draw, first player determination)
  - Handled directly by `GameFlowManager`
  - No player input required, automatic progression

### **AI Integration Architecture**
- **AIPhaseProcessor**: AI's equivalent to App.jsx
  - Complete AI player interface across all game phases
  - **Self-Routing Design**: Executes actions directly rather than returning decisions
  - **Dependencies**: ActionProcessor and GameStateManager injected during initialization
  - **Method Pattern**: `execute*Turn()` methods perform actions, don't return decisions

- **Decision Flow**: SequentialPhaseManager ‚Üí AIPhaseProcessor ‚Üí (aiLogic.js + ActionProcessor + GameStateManager)
- **Core Principle**: AI uses identical pathways as human players but manages its own execution flow

### **Data Computation Architecture** ‚úÖ COMPLETED (2025-09-28)
- **Problem Solved**: Eliminated circular dependency between gameLogic.js and GameDataService
- **Refactor Completed**: Successfully extracted pure calculation functions to dedicated module
- **Implementation Actions**:
  - **Extracted**: Moved `calculateEffectiveStats`, `calculateEffectiveShipStats`, and `getShipStatus` to new `statsCalculator.js`
  - **Separated**: Pure calculation logic (statsCalculator) from caching layer (GameDataService)
  - **Eliminated**: Removed all circular dependencies - gameLogic.js imports from statsCalculator.js but not vice versa
  - **Result**: Clean data flow: statsCalculator ‚Üí GameDataService ‚Üí all consumers

- **GameDataService** (Current Implementation):
  - **Purpose**: Caching wrapper for stats calculations
  - **Data Flow**: statsCalculator.js ‚Üí GameDataService ‚Üí gameDataCache ‚Üí consumers
  - **Core Methods**:
    - `getEffectiveStats(drone, lane)` - Drone combat calculations with lane-specific bonuses
    - `getEffectiveShipStats(playerState, placedSections)` - Ship resource calculations (energy, shields, CPU limits)
  - **Caching Layer**: gameDataCache with automatic state-change invalidation for optimal performance
  - **React Integration**: useGameData hook provides clean component access with automatic cache benefits

- **Architecture Benefits**:
  - **No Circular Dependencies**: Clean separation between calculation and consumption
  - **Consistency**: Single source of truth for all computed game data
  - **Performance**: Intelligent caching prevents redundant expensive calculations
  - **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns
  - **Server Readiness**: Complete abstraction layer ready for client-server migration

- **Verification (2025-09-28)**:
  - **statsCalculator.js**: Created with pure calculation functions, no external dependencies
  - **Circular Dependencies**: Verified eliminated - no imports between gameLogic.js and GameDataService
  - **Code Duplication**: Removed duplicate `getShipStatus` function from gameLogic.js
  - **Build Status**: ‚úÖ Successful build with no errors
  - **Import Chain**: statsCalculator.js ‚Üí GameDataService.js ‚Üí all consumers (clean flow)

### **Component Data Flow Architecture** ‚úÖ COMPLETED (2025-09-27)
- **Achievement**: 100% GameDataService usage across entire codebase
- **Problem Solved**: Fixed critical middle lane bonus calculation issues in utility functions
- **Architecture Violations Eliminated**:
  - **cardDrawUtils.js**: Replaced hardcoded hand limits with GameDataService calculations
  - **gameLogic.js**: Fixed energy initialization to use proper placed sections
  - **aiLogic.js**: Removed direct calculation bypasses, use only GameDataService
- **Critical Bug Fixes**:
  - **Power Cell Middle Lane**: Now correctly provides 12 energy (10 base + 2 bonus)
  - **Bridge Middle Lane**: Now correctly provides 6 card hand limit (5 base + 1 bonus)
  - **UI-Game Consistency**: Stats displayed in UI now match actual game mechanics
- **Benefits Realized**:
  - **Component Independence**: No prop drilling for computed data
  - **Architectural Consistency**: All components and utilities follow identical data access patterns
  - **Server Migration Ready**: Direct hooks translate cleanly to server-based data fetching
  - **Cache Efficiency**: GameDataService caching handles multiple calls efficiently
- **Verification**: 100% GameDataService usage - no direct calculation calls remain in codebase

## üéÆ **ROUND SEQUENCE FLOW ARCHITECTURE** ‚úÖ UPDATED (2025-09-28)

### **Phase Categories & Manager Responsibilities**

**AUTOMATIC_PHASES** (No player input, handled by GameFlowManager):
- `energyReset` - Resets energy and deployment budget at round start
- `draw` - Automatic card drawing to hand limits

**SIMULTANEOUS_PHASES** (Both players commit, handled by SimultaneousActionManager):
- `mandatoryDiscard` - Discard excess cards (conditional)
- `determineFirstPlayer` - First player determination with player acknowledgment
- `allocateShields` - Shield placement (conditional)
- `mandatoryDroneRemoval` - Remove excess drones (conditional)

**SEQUENTIAL_PHASES** (Turn-based, handled by SequentialPhaseManager):
- `deployment` - Drone deployment phase
- `action` - Main combat phase

### **Round Flow Control**

**GameFlowManager Orchestration:**
```
ROUND_PHASES = ['determineFirstPlayer', 'energyReset', 'mandatoryDiscard',
                'optionalDiscard', 'draw', 'allocateShields',
                'mandatoryDroneRemoval', 'deployment', 'action']
```

**Phase Progression Logic:**
1. **GameFlowManager.transitionToPhase()** - Updates gameState.turnPhase
2. **Conditional Phase Skipping** - `isPhaseRequired()` checks game state
3. **Manager Delegation**:
   - Automatic ‚Üí GameFlowManager processes directly
   - Simultaneous ‚Üí Delegates to SimultaneousActionManager
   - Sequential ‚Üí Delegates to SequentialPhaseManager

**First Player Acknowledgment System** ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED (2025-09-28):
- `determineFirstPlayer` now requires player acknowledgment via Continue button
- `SimultaneousActionManager.acknowledgeFirstPlayer()` handles player confirmation
- Shows `WaitingForPlayerModal` when one player acknowledged but waiting for opponent
- AI auto-acknowledges in single-player mode for seamless progression
- Proper multiplayer synchronization ensures both players see first player before continuing

**Phase Order Correction** ‚úÖ FIXED (2025-09-28):
- Moved `determineFirstPlayer` to START of round (before energyReset)
- Ensures turn order is established before resource management and card handling
- Matches GamePlayFlowAndUI.txt specification for logical game flow
- Added missing `determineFirstPlayer` to `SimultaneousActionManager.phaseCommitments`

### **UI Rendering Flow**

**AppRouter Routing Decision:**
- Pre-game phases ‚Üí Dedicated screens (DroneSelectionScreen, etc.)
- ALL round phases ‚Üí App.jsx (default case)

**App.jsx Responsibilities:**
- **Pure UI Layer** - Renders based on gameState.turnPhase
- **Event-Driven** - Subscribes to multiple managers for UI cues
- **Reactive** - Never drives phase transitions, only responds

**Manager ‚Üí UI Communication:**
- **GameStateManager** - Core state changes
- **GameFlowManager** - Phase transition events with modal data
- **SimultaneousActionManager** - Player completion status
- **SequentialPhaseManager** - Turn timing and pass events

---

## üèóÔ∏è **SYSTEM COMPONENT ARCHITECTURE**

### **State Management Layer**

**GameStateManager**
- Single source of truth for all game state
- Player-namespaced state organization
- Event emission for state changes
- Pure data store with no game logic

#### **üö® CRITICAL: Game State Structure Reference**

**MANDATORY READING**: This section defines the exact game state structure. All code MUST follow these patterns to prevent runtime errors.

**Complete State Structure:**
```javascript
gameState = {
  // Application Level
  appState: 'menu' | 'inGame' | 'gameOver',
  gameMode: 'local' | 'host' | 'guest',
  gameActive: boolean,
  turnPhase: string,

  // Player States (DIRECT PROPERTIES - NOT NESTED)
  player1: {
    name: string,
    energy: number,
    hand: Array,
    dronesOnBoard: { lane1: [], lane2: [], lane3: [] },
    shipSections: Object,
    // ... other player properties
  },
  player2: {
    // Same structure as player1
  },

  // Placed Sections (TOP-LEVEL PROPERTIES)
  placedSections: Array,           // Player1's placed sections
  opponentPlacedSections: Array,   // Player2's placed sections

  // Other Game State
  currentPlayer: string,
  passInfo: Object,
  // ... other properties
}
```

**‚úÖ CORRECT Player State Access:**
```javascript
// In GameStateManager methods
getLocalPlayerState() {
  const localId = this.getLocalPlayerId(); // Returns 'player1' or 'player2'
  return this.state[localId];              // ‚úÖ CORRECT
}

// In GameDataService and other files
const gameState = gameStateManager.getState();
const localPlayerId = gameStateManager.getLocalPlayerId();
const playerState = gameState[localPlayerId];     // ‚úÖ CORRECT
```

**‚ùå INCORRECT Player State Access:**
```javascript
// NEVER DO THIS - gameState.players does not exist
const playerState = gameState.players[playerId];  // ‚ùå WRONG - Will cause "Cannot read properties of undefined"
```

**‚úÖ CORRECT Placed Sections Access:**
```javascript
// Placed sections are stored at top level, not on player objects
const getPlacedSectionsForEngine = () => {
  return {
    player1: gameState.placedSections,           // ‚úÖ CORRECT
    player2: gameState.opponentPlacedSections    // ‚úÖ CORRECT
  };
};

// For conditional access
const sections = playerId === 'player1'
  ? gameState.placedSections
  : gameState.opponentPlacedSections;            // ‚úÖ CORRECT
```

**‚ùå INCORRECT Placed Sections Access:**
```javascript
// NEVER DO THIS - placedSections are not stored on player objects
const sections = gameState.player1.placedSections;  // ‚ùå WRONG - Property doesn't exist
const sections = gameState.players[playerId].placedSections; // ‚ùå WRONG - Double error
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID:**
1. **Non-existent `players` object**: There is no `gameState.players` - player states are direct properties
2. **Placed sections on players**: `placedSections` are top-level properties, not on player objects
3. **Assuming nested structure**: The state is mostly flat, not deeply nested

**üìã REFERENCE CHECKLIST:**
- ‚úÖ Use `gameState.player1` and `gameState.player2` directly
- ‚úÖ Use `gameState[playerId]` for dynamic access where playerId is 'player1' or 'player2'
- ‚úÖ Use `gameState.placedSections` and `gameState.opponentPlacedSections` for placement data
- ‚ùå Never use `gameState.players[...]`
- ‚ùå Never access `playerState.placedSections`

**ActionProcessor**
- Neutral engine for processing all player actions
- Action validation and execution
- Queue management for complex operations
- Mode-agnostic action handling

### **Phase Coordination Layer**

**GameFlowManager**
- Master game flow controller
- Phase transition orchestration via ActionProcessor
- Automatic phase processing for system-driven phases (draw, energy reset)
- Conditional phase execution based on game state
- State monitoring for sequential and simultaneous phase completion
- **Note**: Delegates all state updates to ActionProcessor

### **Data Computation Layer** ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED

**GameDataService**
- Centralized computation coordinator for all effective stats calculations
- Caching wrapper around original game engine functions
- GameStateManager integration for real-time data access
- React hook integration via useGameData

**gameDataCache**
- Performance optimization layer with Map-based storage
- Automatic cache invalidation on game state changes
- Hit/miss statistics tracking for performance monitoring
- Memory-efficient with deterministic key generation

### **GameStateManager Update Ownership** ‚úÖ REFACTORED (2025-09-29)

**Simplified ownership after removing SequentialPhaseManager and SimultaneousActionManager:**

**ActionProcessor** (Primary State Executor):
- OWNS: ALL player state updates (hand, energy, drones, ships, etc.)
- OWNS: `currentPlayer` (turn transitions within phases)
- OWNS: `passInfo` (all pass state management)
- OWNS: `commitments` (simultaneous phase commitment tracking)
- OWNS: `placedSections` (ship placement data)
- Executes phase transitions via `processPhaseTransition()`
- Single source of truth for all game state changes

**GameFlowManager** (Phase Orchestrator):
- OWNS: `turnPhase`, `gameStage`, `roundNumber`, `gameActive`
- Monitors state via GameStateManager subscriptions
- Delegates ALL state updates to ActionProcessor
- Only performs metadata updates (phase tracking, game stage)
- Decides WHEN to transition, ActionProcessor executes HOW

**AIPhaseProcessor** (AI Decision Interface):
- DOES NOT own state - delegates all updates to ActionProcessor
- Self-triggers on AI turns via GameStateManager subscription
- Makes decisions, then calls ActionProcessor methods

**Architecture Pattern**:
```
GameFlowManager (orchestrate) ‚Üí ActionProcessor (execute) ‚Üí GameStateManager (store)
```

**Enforcement**: Single ownership eliminates race conditions and architectural violations

### **AI Decision Layer**

**AIPhaseProcessor**
- AI's complete game interface
- Phase-specific decision making (`executeDeploymentTurn`, `executeActionTurn`)
- Pass decision logic (`executePass`)
- Integration with aiLogic.js for decision algorithms

### **User Interface Layer**

**AppRouter**
- Central routing based on game state
- Manager initialization and dependency injection
- Screen transition coordination
- Pre-game and active gameplay separation

**App.jsx**
- Active gameplay UI (deployment, action, combat phases)
- Player-contextual perspective management
- Local UI state management only
- Event-driven updates from state managers

**Phase Screens**
- Dedicated components for pre-game phases
- Self-contained state management
- Multiplayer coordination and waiting states

## üîÑ **DATA FLOW PATTERNS**

### **Human Player Action Flow**
```
App.jsx ‚Üí ActionProcessor ‚Üí GameStateManager ‚Üí Event Emission ‚Üí UI Updates
```

### **AI Player Action Flow**
```
SequentialPhaseManager ‚Üí AIPhaseProcessor ‚Üí ActionProcessor ‚Üí GameStateManager ‚Üí Event Emission ‚Üí UI Updates
```

### **Data Computation Flow** ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED
```
Component ‚Üí GameDataService ‚Üí gameDataCache (check) ‚Üí gameEngine.calculate* ‚Üí Cache Store ‚Üí Return Result
                            ‚Üì
GameStateManager (state changes) ‚Üí gameDataCache.invalidateAll() ‚Üí Fresh calculations
```

### **Phase Transition Flow**
```
GameFlowManager ‚Üí Phase Managers ‚Üí ActionProcessor ‚Üí GameStateManager ‚Üí Event Emission ‚Üí UI Updates
```

### **State Update Flow**
```
GameStateManager ‚Üí Event Emission ‚Üí All Subscribed Components ‚Üí UI Re-render
```

### **First Player Determination Flow** ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED (2025-09-29)
```
GameFlowManager.transitionToPhase('determineFirstPlayer')
    ‚Üì
SimultaneousActionManager.initializeFirstPlayerPhase()
    ‚Üì
firstPlayerUtils.processFirstPlayerDetermination(gameState)
    ‚Üì
GameFlowManager receives result and applies stateUpdates (currentPlayer, firstPlayerOfRound)
    ‚Üì
Both players acknowledge via SimultaneousActionManager.acknowledgeFirstPlayer()
    ‚Üì
Phase completes when both acknowledged
```

**Architecture Pattern**: SimultaneousActionManager calculates and returns results, GameFlowManager applies state changes during phase transitions. This maintains clear ownership boundaries where GameFlowManager orchestrates all phase transitions and their associated state updates.

### **Sequential Phase Transition Flow** ‚úÖ FIXED (2025-09-29)
```
SequentialPhaseManager emits 'phase_completed' event
    ‚Üì
GameFlowManager.onSequentialPhaseComplete() (SINGLE subscription)
    ‚Üì
GameFlowManager.transitionToPhase() orchestrates next phase
    ‚Üì
SequentialPhaseManager.initializePhase() resets passInfo and completion guard
```

**Critical Fixes Applied**:
- **PassInfo Reset**: Each sequential phase starts with fresh passInfo to prevent carryover
- **Completion Guard**: Prevents duplicate completion events for the same phase
- **Single Event Source**: GameFlowManager only subscribes to SequentialPhaseManager, not ActionProcessor
- **Architecture Pattern**: SequentialPhaseManager signals completion, GameFlowManager orchestrates transitions

---

## üß© **SEPARATION OF CONCERNS**

### **Pure Game Logic**
- **GameStateManager**: Data storage and event emission
- **ActionProcessor**: Action execution and validation
- **Phase Managers**: Coordination and flow control
- **Utility Functions**: Reusable game mechanics

### **AI Interface**
- **aiLogic.js**: AI decision algorithms and business logic
- **Clear separation**: AI interface (AIPhaseProcessor) vs AI implementation (aiLogic.js)

### **User Interface**
- **AppRouter**: Navigation and routing
- **App.jsx**: Active gameplay presentation
- **Phase Screens**: Pre-game phase presentation
- **Components**: Reusable UI elements

### **Mode Abstraction**
- All core components are mode-agnostic
- Single-player vs multiplayer handled through configuration
- AI integration transparent to core game logic
- Server-ready architecture with clean client/server boundaries

---

## üîß **ARCHITECTURAL PRINCIPLES**

### **Event-Driven Design**
- Components communicate through events, not direct coupling
- GameStateManager as central event hub
- Loose coupling enables easy testing and modification

### **Single Responsibility**
- Each manager handles one specific concern
- Clear boundaries between coordination, execution, and presentation
- Easy to reason about and maintain

### **Mode Agnostic Design**
- Core game logic independent of single-player vs multiplayer
- AI integration through same pathways as human players
- Server deployment ready with minimal changes

### **Dependency Injection**
- Managers receive dependencies during initialization
- Clear dependency relationships
- Easy to mock and test individual components

### **Circular Dependency Prevention**
- **Principle**: No module should both provide and consume the same service
- **Pattern**: Extract shared logic to dedicated modules
- **Example**: statsCalculator.js provides calculations, GameDataService wraps with caching, gameLogic.js consumes
- **Benefits**: Clear data flow, easier testing, prevents architectural confusion

---

## ‚úÖ **CRITICAL BUG FIXES COMPLETED** (2025-09-28)

### **Phase Transition Architecture Bug Fixes - RESOLVED**

**Problem Solved**: Multiple critical bugs in phase transition and AI decision handling that prevented proper game flow:

**Issues Fixed**:
1. **ActionProcessor Method Confusion** (Lines 1057, 1059, 1186, 1188):
   - **Bug**: Incorrectly called `processTurnTransition` instead of `processPhaseTransition` for phase changes
   - **Impact**: Game couldn't transition from deployment ‚Üí action phase when both players passed
   - **Fix**: Changed to correct `processPhaseTransition` method calls

2. **Parameter Name Mismatch** (Lines 1186, 1188):
   - **Bug**: Used `nextPhase` parameter instead of expected `newPhase`
   - **Impact**: `processPhaseTransition` received undefined parameters
   - **Fix**: Updated to use correct `newPhase` parameter name

3. **AI Decision Structure Handling** (SequentialPhaseManager line 225):
   - **Bug**: AI pass decisions wrapped in deployment format caused undefined payload access
   - **Impact**: "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'droneToDeploy')" runtime error
   - **Fix**: Added guard clause to detect wrapped pass decisions (`decision.type === 'deployment' && decision.decision?.type === 'pass'`)

**Critical Architecture Pattern Established**:
```javascript
// ActionProcessor Method Distinctions:
processPhaseTransition({ newPhase: 'action' })    // Changes game phases (deployment ‚Üí action)
processTurnTransition({ newPlayer: 'player2' })   // Switches players within same phase
```

**AI Decision Structure Pattern**:
```javascript
// AIPhaseProcessor wraps all decisions:
{
  type: 'deployment',           // Wrapper type
  decision: { type: 'pass' },   // OR { type: 'deploy', payload: {...} }
  playerId: 'player2'
}
// SequentialPhaseManager must check both decision.type AND decision.decision.type
```

**Architecture Benefits Achieved**:
- ‚úÖ **Phase Flow Fixed**: Deployment ‚Üí action transitions now work correctly
- ‚úÖ **AI Error Elimination**: No more undefined payload crashes
- ‚úÖ **Pass Loop Prevention**: Both players passing now properly advances game phase
- ‚úÖ **Method Clarity**: Clear distinction between phase vs turn transitions

### **GameDebugModal Development Tool - ADDED**

**New Component**: `GameDebugModal.jsx` for game state debugging
- **Access**: Settings dropdown ‚Üí "Debug View" in GameHeader
- **Features**:
  - **Raw State Tab**: Complete GameStateManager data inspection
  - **Calculated Stats Tab**: GameDataService computations display
- **Usage**: Essential tool for debugging game state and phase transition issues
- **Integration**: Added to App.jsx with proper modal state management

---

## ‚úÖ **ARCHITECTURE VIOLATIONS RESOLVED** (2025-09-27)

### **App.jsx Direct State Updates (Architectural Debt) - FIXED**

**Problem Solved**: App.jsx previously contained direct state setter functions that bypassed manager architecture:
```javascript
// VIOLATIONS REMOVED from App.jsx:
setTurnPhase(result.phaseTransition.newPhase);      // REMOVED
setCurrentPlayer(result.phaseTransition.firstPlayer); // REMOVED
setFirstPlayerOfRound(firstPlayer);                 // REMOVED
updateGameState(payload);                           // REMOVED
```

**Resolution Actions Completed**:
1. ‚úÖ **Removed Direct State Setters**: All architectural violations eliminated from App.jsx
2. ‚úÖ **Fixed Related Screens**: MenuScreen.jsx and LobbyScreen.jsx updated to use GameStateManager properly
3. ‚úÖ **Verified Functionality**: Manager-based architecture handles all state transitions correctly
4. ‚úÖ **Build Verification**: No runtime errors, application functions normally

**Correct Architecture Now Enforced**:
```
App.jsx ‚Üí Manager ‚Üí GameStateManager ‚Üí UI Updates ‚úÖ
```

**Architecture Compliance**: App.jsx now properly follows event-driven pattern with no direct state manipulation

### **UI Component Architecture** ‚úÖ REFACTORED (2025-09-27)

**Problem Solved**: App.jsx was a monolithic 4000+ line component handling all UI concerns
**Solution**: Systematic component extraction with proper separation of concerns

**Component Extraction Results**:
- **GameHeader.jsx** - Player resources, game controls, and phase display
- **GameBattlefield.jsx** - Ship sections and drone lanes wrapper
- **GameFooter.jsx** - Tabbed interface coordinator with modular sub-components
- **footer/HandView.jsx** - Hand cards, deck/discard piles, optional discard controls
- **footer/DronesView.jsx** - Drone pool display for deployment
- **footer/LogView.jsx** - Game log with CSV download functionality

**CSS Module Implementation**:
- **GameFooter.module.css** - Comprehensive styling using Tailwind @apply directive
- **Consistent Design System** - Semantic class names replace inline styles
- **Maintainable Styling** - Centralized styles with component-scoped CSS modules

**Architecture Benefits Achieved**:
- **Reduced Complexity**: App.jsx reduced from 4000+ to ~3700 lines with clear component boundaries
- **Better Maintainability**: Smaller, focused components easier to debug and modify
- **Improved Reusability**: Modular components can be reused across different contexts
- **Cleaner Prop Management**: Each component receives only the props it needs
- **Separation of Concerns**: UI layout (App.jsx) vs content rendering (sub-components)

**Build Verification**: ‚úÖ All components compile successfully, no runtime errors

### **Clean Architecture Principles**

**Business Logic Layer (No UI)**:
- SimultaneousActionManager
- ActionProcessor
- GameFlowManager
- SequentialPhaseManager

**UI Layer (Reactive Only)**:
- App.jsx (main layout coordinator)
- AppRouter (navigation and routing)
- GameHeader, GameBattlefield, GameFooter (major UI sections)
- footer/* components (specialized UI sections)
- Dedicated phase screens

**Data Layer**:
- GameStateManager (single source of truth)
- GameDataService (computed data with caching)

**Event Flow Pattern**:
```
User Input ‚Üí App.jsx ‚Üí Manager ‚Üí GameStateManager ‚Üí State Change Event ‚Üí App.jsx Re-render
```

### **Section Guidelines**

**Section 1: Imports**
- Grouped by type with clear subsections (React core, UI components, modals, hooks, data/logic, managers, utilities)
- Clear categorization prevents import confusion and maintains clean dependencies

**Section 2: Component Declaration**
- Simple functional component declaration with clear naming

**Section 3: Hooks & State**
- **Critical Ordering**: Custom hooks ‚Üí useState ‚Üí useRef ‚Üí hooks dependent on refs ‚Üí state/refs dependent on gameState
- All useState declarations consolidated to eliminate scattered state
- useRef positioned after gameState destructuring to prevent "Cannot access before initialization"
- **Section 3.4**: For hooks requiring refs as parameters (e.g., useExplosions needs droneRefs, gameAreaRef)
- **Section 3.5**: For state and refs requiring gameState values for initialization (e.g., useState(currentPlayer), useRef(passInfo))

**Section 4: Manager Subscriptions**
- Event-driven architecture initialization and subscriptions
- Dependency injection pattern for clean architecture
- All manager setup isolated for easy testing and modification

**Section 5: Computed Values & Memoization**
- Performance-critical section with all useMemo declarations
- Game state destructuring happens here for proper variable access
- **Section 5.2**: Ref synchronization useEffects to keep refs updated with state values
- All derived calculations optimized to prevent unnecessary re-renders

**Section 6: Event Handlers**
- User interaction handlers grouped by functionality (multiplayer, UI, game actions)
- All handlers use useCallback for performance optimization
- Clear coordination between UI actions and manager layer

**Section 7: Game Logic Functions**
- Business logic wrappers coordinating UI with game engine
- Clean separation: UI logic here, game rules in gameEngine
- All game logic delegated to engine for architectural compliance

**Section 8: Effect Hooks**
- Side effects organized by purpose (targeting calculations, win condition monitoring, interception monitoring)
- Clear separation between different types of reactive updates
- Critical for maintaining proper game state synchronization
- **Section 8.3**: Interception monitoring for AI attack interception logic

**Section 9: Render**
- Clean JSX with component composition architecture
- Minimal inline logic, all complexity handled in previous sections
- Clear prop passing for reactive updates

### **Critical Architecture Rules**

- **Variable Initialization Order**: gameState destructuring must happen before refs to prevent runtime errors
- **Hook Dependencies**: Custom hooks ‚Üí local state ‚Üí refs ‚Üí effects
- **Performance**: All expensive calculations in Section 5 with proper memoization
- **Separation of Concerns**: UI logic in App.jsx, game rules in gameEngine
- **Event-Driven**: All state changes through manager layer, never direct setState

### **Maintenance Notes**
- Each section must have comprehensive header comments explaining purpose and organization
- Follow documented ordering to prevent initialization and dependency errors
- All new functionality should fit within existing section structure
- Performance optimizations (useMemo, useCallback) are mandatory for large components
- Code within sections should be logically ordered
- Related functions should be grouped together
- TODO comments should include clear categorization (TECHNICAL DEBT, UI VALIDATION, etc.)
