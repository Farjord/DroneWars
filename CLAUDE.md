## üö® **CRITICAL TODO: FIX PASS LOGIC ARCHITECTURE VIOLATION**

### **Current Problem:**
After a player passes, they're still being prompted for actions. Root cause is competing AI turn management systems that violate the server-based architecture.

### **Architecture Violations Identified:**
1. **App.jsx manages AI turn execution** (lines 1839-1886) - AI TURN EXECUTION useEffect determines when AI should act
2. **ActionProcessor calls aiBrain directly** - processAiTurn() bypasses AIPhaseProcessor and calls aiBrain.handleOpponentTurn() directly
3. **Competing turn management** - Both App.jsx and ActionProcessor try to manage AI timing
4. **Missing pass validation** - ActionProcessor doesn't check pass states before triggering actions

### **Detailed Implementation Tasks:**

#### **Task 1: Remove AI Turn Management from App.jsx** ‚ö†Ô∏è HIGH PRIORITY
- **File**: `src/App.jsx` lines 1839-1886
- **Action**: Delete entire AI TURN EXECUTION useEffect
- **Details**: Remove hasBlockingConditions logic, AI timing logic, executeAiTurn function
- **Reason**: App.jsx should be purely reactive to state changes, not drive AI logic
- **Expected Result**: App.jsx becomes pure UI layer as intended in server architecture

#### **Task 2: Expand AIPhaseProcessor for All Phases** ‚ö†Ô∏è HIGH PRIORITY
- **File**: `src/state/AIPhaseProcessor.js`
- **Missing Methods**:
  - `handleDeploymentTurn(gameState)` - AI decisions for deployment phase
  - `handleActionTurn(gameState)` - AI decisions for action phase
  - `shouldPass(gameState, phase)` - Logic to determine when AI should pass
- **Implementation**: Each method calls appropriate aiLogic.js functions, returns decision to ActionProcessor
- **Reason**: AIPhaseProcessor should be AI's complete equivalent to App.jsx for ALL phases

#### **Task 3: Fix ActionProcessor AI Delegation** ‚ö†Ô∏è HIGH PRIORITY
- **File**: `src/state/ActionProcessor.js` method `processAiTurn()`
- **Current Issue**: Directly calls `aiBrain.handleOpponentTurn()` and `aiBrain.handleOpponentAction()`
- **Required Change**: Replace with calls to AIPhaseProcessor methods
- **Implementation**:
  ```javascript
  // Instead of: aiDecision = aiBrain.handleOpponentTurn(...)
  // Use: aiDecision = await this.aiPhaseProcessor.handleDeploymentTurn(currentState)
  ```
- **Reason**: Maintain proper separation - ActionProcessor = neutral engine, AIPhaseProcessor = AI interface

#### **Task 4: Add Pass State Validation** ‚ö†Ô∏è HIGH PRIORITY
- **File**: `src/state/ActionProcessor.js`
- **Location**: Before any player action processing, before calling AIPhaseProcessor
- **Implementation**: Check `passInfo[playerId + 'Passed']` before allowing actions
- **Details**:
  - Validate human player hasn't passed before processing their actions
  - Validate AI hasn't passed before calling AIPhaseProcessor
  - Only allow phase transitions when both players have acted or passed
- **Reason**: Prevent actions after passing to fix the core reported issue

#### **Task 5: Implement Automatic Turn Management** ‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM PRIORITY
- **File**: `src/state/ActionProcessor.js`
- **Goal**: ActionProcessor automatically determines whose turn it is without App.jsx intervention
- **Implementation**:
  - Check currentPlayer state
  - Check pass status for current player
  - If human player's turn and not passed: wait for App.jsx action
  - If AI player's turn and not passed: call AIPhaseProcessor automatically
  - If both passed: trigger phase transition
- **Reason**: Single source of truth for turn management

### **Expected Outcome:**
- ‚úÖ Pass logic works correctly - no more actions after passing
- ‚úÖ Clean architecture: App.jsx (human UI) ‚Üî ActionProcessor (neutral engine) ‚Üî AIPhaseProcessor (AI interface)
- ‚úÖ Single turn management system (ActionProcessor only)
- ‚úÖ Proper delegation flow: ActionProcessor ‚Üí AIPhaseProcessor ‚Üí aiLogic.js ‚Üí ActionProcessor

### **Testing Checklist:**
- [ ] Human player passes ‚Üí no more action prompts
- [ ] AI passes ‚Üí no more AI actions
- [ ] Both players pass ‚Üí phase transitions correctly
- [ ] App.jsx has no AI turn management code
- [ ] AIPhaseProcessor handles all AI decisions
- [ ] ActionProcessor is the only turn manager

## üöÄ **NEXT PHASE: SERVER IMPLEMENTATION**

**Goal:** Implement actual server-based multiplayer system as described in original vision.

### **Remaining Work for Full Server Architecture:**

**Priority 1: Create Server Layer**
- **server/GameServer.js** - Central game instance server
- **server/SessionManager.js** - Handle multiple game sessions
- **server/PlayerConnectionManager.js** - Manage player connections
- **network/GameClient.js** - Client-side network interface

**Priority 2: Network Integration**
- Remove current P2P (PeerJS) multiplayer system
- Replace with client-server WebSocket communication
- Update App.jsx to connect to server instead of direct game logic
- Route all actions through network layer to server

**Priority 3: Server-Side Game Logic**
- Move GameStateManager, GameFlowManager, SimultaneousActionManager to server
- Keep only UI state management on client (App.jsx)
- Implement server-side validation and anti-cheat measures
- Add spectator mode support

---

## ü§ñ **AI ARCHITECTURE FLOW**

### **Proper AI Decision Flow (Intended Architecture):**

**For Human Player:**
- **App.jsx** ‚Üí **ActionProcessor/PhaseManager** ‚Üí **GameStateManager**
- App.jsx handles all player interactions across all phases
- App.jsx sends actions to ActionProcessor/PhaseManager for execution

**For AI Player:**
- **ActionProcessor** ‚Üí **AIPhaseProcessor** ‚Üí **logic/aiLogic.js** ‚Üí **AIPhaseProcessor** ‚Üí **ActionProcessor** ‚Üí **GameStateManager**
- AIPhaseProcessor is AI's equivalent to App.jsx for ALL phases
- ActionProcessor delegates to AIPhaseProcessor when it's AI's turn
- AIPhaseProcessor calls aiLogic.js for decision-making
- AIPhaseProcessor submits actions back to ActionProcessor for execution

### **Key Principles:**
- **ActionProcessor** = Neutral game engine that both human and AI interact with
- **App.jsx** = Human player interface (UI layer)
- **AIPhaseProcessor** = AI player interface (decision layer)
- **logic/aiLogic.js** = AI business logic (called by AIPhaseProcessor)
- **GameStateManager** = Single source of truth (updated only by ActionProcessor)

## üéØ **SERVER IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**

### **Phase 3.1: Server Infrastructure**

**Create Core Server Components:**
```javascript
// server/GameServer.js - Central game instance
class GameServer {
  constructor() {
    this.gameStateManager = new GameStateManager();
    this.gameFlowManager = new GameFlowManager();
    this.simultaneousActionManager = new SimultaneousActionManager();
    this.aiPhaseProcessor = new AIPhaseProcessor();
  }

  handlePlayerAction(playerId, action) {
    // Route to appropriate manager
    // Broadcast state changes to clients
  }
}

// server/SessionManager.js - Multiple game sessions
class SessionManager {
  createGame(hostPlayerId) { /* */ }
  joinGame(gameId, playerId) { /* */ }
  endGame(gameId) { /* */ }
}

// network/GameClient.js - Client network interface
class GameClient {
  connect(serverId) { /* */ }
  sendAction(action) { /* */ }
  onStateUpdate(callback) { /* */ }
}
```

### **Phase 3.2: Network Protocol**

**Define Client-Server Messages:**
```javascript
// Client ‚Üí Server
{
  type: 'PLAYER_ACTION',
  gameId: 'abc123',
  playerId: 'player1',
  action: {
    type: 'submitDroneSelection',
    data: { drones: [...] }
  }
}

// Server ‚Üí Client
{
  type: 'GAME_STATE_UPDATE',
  gameId: 'abc123',
  updates: {
    turnPhase: 'deckSelection',
    player1: { /* updated player state */ }
  }
}
```

### **Phase 3.3: Client Refactor**

- Replace direct manager calls with network requests
- Keep local UI state management
- Add connection status handling
- Add reconnection logic

**Remove P2P System:**
- Remove PeerJS dependency
- Remove MultiplayerLobby P2P logic
- Replace with server lobby system

### **Phase 3.4: Advanced Features**

**Server-Side Features:**
- Game session persistence

## üéÆ **CURRENT GAME FLOW (WORKING)**

### **Pre-Game Flow (Simultaneous Phases):**
1. **droneSelection** ‚Üí SimultaneousActionManager coordinates player commitments
2. **deckSelection** ‚Üí SimultaneousActionManager coordinates player commitments
3. **placement** ‚Üí SimultaneousActionManager coordinates player commitments

### **Round Loop Flow (Mixed Phase Types):**
4. **mandatoryDiscard** (Simultaneous) ‚Üí Only if players exceed hand limit
5. **draw** (Automatic) ‚Üí GameFlowManager handles automatically with cardDrawUtils
6. **determineFirstPlayer** (Automatic) ‚Üí GameFlowManager handles automatically with firstPlayerUtils
7. **allocateShields** (Simultaneous) ‚Üí Only if players have shields to allocate
8. **mandatoryDroneRemoval** (Simultaneous) ‚Üí Only if players exceed drone limit
9. **deployment** (Sequential) ‚Üí ActionProcessor handles turn-based play
10. **action** (Sequential) ‚Üí ActionProcessor handles turn-based play

### **Phase Type Architecture:**
- **Simultaneous Phases**: Coordinated by SimultaneousActionManager (player commitments + AI auto-completion)
- **Automatic Phases**: Handled directly by GameFlowManager (no player input, just happens and progresses)
- **Sequential Phases**: Handled by ActionProcessor (turn-based with proper action validation)

### **Conditional Phase Logic:**
- GameFlowManager.isPhaseRequired() skips unnecessary phases automatically
- Phases only execute if game state requires them (e.g., skip mandatoryDiscard if no hand limit violations)

**The architecture now features a clean separation between player interaction phases and automatic system phases, ready for server deployment.**
